;; Notice
;; To create an executable 
;;   $ raco exe -o hello hello.rkt
;; 
;; see https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe.html
;; 
;; To share stand-alone executables:
;;   $ raco distribute <directory> executable ... 
;; 
;; e.g
;;   $ raco distribute greetings hello.exe
;;
;; creates a directory "greetings" (if the directory doesnâ€™t exist already),
;; and it copies the executables "hello.exe" and "goodbye.exe" into "greetings".
;; 
;; see https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe-dist.html

;; For your convenience, we have included LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-APACHE files.
;; If you would prefer to use a different license, replace those files with the
;; desired license.
;;
;; Some users like to add a `private/` directory, place auxiliary files there,
;; and require them in `main.rkt`.

;; See the current version of the racket style guide here:
